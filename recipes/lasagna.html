    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of layers of wide, flat pasta
      sheets alternated with rich fillings such as seasoned ground meat (often
      beef or pork), tomato sauce, b√©chamel or ricotta cheese, and melted
      mozzarella. Each layer is carefully stacked and baked to perfection,
      creating a hearty, flavorful casserole with a golden, bubbling top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lasagna is known for its comforting, savory taste and is often served as a
      main course at gatherings or special meals. Variations can include
      vegetables, chicken, seafood, or be made entirely vegetarian.
