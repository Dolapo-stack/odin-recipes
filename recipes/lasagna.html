    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of layers of wide, flat pasta
      sheets alternated with rich fillings such as seasoned ground meat (often
      beef or pork), tomato sauce, béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melted
      mozzarella. Each layer is carefully stacked and baked to perfection,
      creating a hearty, flavorful casserole with a golden, bubbling top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lasagna is known for its comforting, savory taste and is often served as a
      main course at gatherings or special meals. Variations can include
      vegetables, chicken, seafood, or be made entirely vegetarian.
